Requires at least: 2.8.0
Tested up to: 3.0-alpha
Stable tag: 0.8.1

This plugin will check your posts, custom fields and the blogroll for broken links and missing images and notify you if any are found. 

== Description ==
This plugin will monitor your blog looking for broken links and let you know if any are found.

**Features**

* Monitors links in your posts, pages, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).
* Detects links that don't work and missing images.
* Notifies you on the Dashboard if any are found.
* Also detects redirected links.
* Makes broken links display differently in posts (optional).
* Link checking intervals can be configured.
* New/modified posts are checked ASAP.
* You view broken links, redirects, and a complete list of links used on your site, in the *Tools -> Broken Links* tab. 
* Searching and filtering links by URL, anchor text and so on is also possible.
* Each link can be edited or unlinked directly via the plugin's page, without manually editing each post.

**Basic Usage**

Once installed, the plugin will begin parsing your posts, bookmarks (AKA blogroll), etc and looking for links. Depending on the size of your site this can take a few minutes or even several hours. When parsing is complete the plugin will start checking each link to see if it works. Again, how long this takes depends on how big your site is and how many links there are. You can monitor the progress and set various link checking options in *Settings -> Link Checker*.

Note : Currently the plugin only runs when you have at least one tab of the Dashboard open. Cron support will likely be added in a later version.

The broken links, if any are found, will show up in a new tab of WP admin panel - *Tools -> Broken Links*. A notification will also appear in the "Broken Link Checker" widget on the Dashboard. To save display space, you can keep the widget closed and configure it to expand automatically when problematic links are detected.

The "Broken Links" tab will by default display broken links that have been detected so far. However, you can use the subnavigation links on that page to view redirects or see a listing of all links - working or not - instead.

There are several actions associated with each link listed - 

* "Details" shows more info about the link. You can also toggle link details by clicking on the "link text" cell.
* "Edit URL" lets you change the URL of that link. If the link is present in more than one place (e.g. both in a post and in the blogroll) then all instances of that URL will be changed.
* "Unlink" removes the link but leaves the link text intact.
* "Exclude" adds the link's URL to the exclusion list. Excluded URLs won't be checked again.
* "Discard" lets you manually mark the link as valid. This is useful if you know it was detected as broken only due to a temporary glitch or similar. The link will still be checked normally later.

== Changelog ==

*This is an automatically generated changelog*

= 0.8.1 =
* Updated Italian translation.
* Removed the survey link.

= 0.8 =
* Initial support for performing some action on multiple links at once.
* Added a "Delete sources" bulk action that lets you delete all posts (or blogroll entries) that contain any of the selected links. Doing this in WP 2.9 and up this will instead move the posts to the trash, not delete them permanently.
* New bulk action : Unlink. Removes all selected links from all posts.
* New bulk action : Fix redirects. Analyzes the selected links and replaces any redirects with direct links.
* Added a notice asking the user to take the feedback survey.
* Update the .POT file with new i18n strings.

= 0.7.4 =
* Fixed a minor bug where the plugin would display an incorrect number of links in the "Displaying x-y of z" label when the user moves to a different page of the results.
* Added Ukrainian translation.

= 0.7.3 =
* Reverted to the old access-checking algorithm + some error suppression.

= 0.6.1 =
* Some translation-related fixes.

= 0.6 =

* Editing links with relative URLs via the plugin's interface should now work properly. Previously the plugin would just fail silently and behave as if the link was edited, even if it wasn't.

= 0.5.14 =
* Made the timeout value used when checking links user-configurable.
* The plugin will now report an error instead of failing silently when it can't create the necessary database tables.

= 0.5.12 =
* Let the user set a custom temporary directory, if the default one is not accessible for some reason.

* Fixed a bug where URLs that only differ in character case would be treated as equivalent.

= 0.5.1 =
* Fix a bug when the plugin creates a DB table with the wrong prefix.

= 0.5 =
* This is a near-complete rewrite with a lot of new features.

* Fix SQL error when a post is deleted.

= 0.4.10 =
* Changed required access caps for "Manage -> Broken Links" from manage\_options to edit\_ohers\_posts. This will allow editor users to access that page and it's functions.

* Link sorting, somewhat experimental.
* JavaScript sorting feature for the broken link list.

= 0.4.8 =
* CURL isn't required anymore. Snoopy is used when CURL isn't available.

* "Unlink" and "Edit" now work for images, too. "Unlink" simply removes the image.

* New and improved (TM) regexps for finding links and images.
