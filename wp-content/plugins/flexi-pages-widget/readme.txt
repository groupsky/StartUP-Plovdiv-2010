* Widget options menu is internationalized. Please refer [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/flexi-pages-widget/other_notes/) for the full list of languages in which the plugin is localized and translation credits.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the compressed file and upload the `flexi-pages-widget.php` file (or `flexi-pages-widget` directory) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

1. Go to WP admin -> Appearance -> Widgets, add the 'Flexi Pages' widget into the sidebar and choose your options. Multiple instances of the widget can be added to the sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After selecting a few pages for exclusion, isn't it possible to deselect all pages? There is always one page selected for exclusion. =

It is possible to deselect all pages. Hold the 'Ctrl' key in your keyboard and click on the name of the page that's not getting deselected.

= What does 'Show only related subpages' and 'Show only strictly related subpages' mean? =

When the option 'Show only related subpages' is selected, a subpage is listed only when the user visits the parent and sibling pages of the subpage. Thus, choosing this option will display the top level pages, children and siblings of the current page, and siblings of the parent page.

'Show only strictly related subpages' is same as the above except that siblings of parent page won't be displayed when on a subpage

= Is there an option to list only subpages and hide the parent pages? =

Although such an option does not exist, the 'Include' option can be used to achieve this. Select 'Include' instead of 'Exclude' and select all the pages you want to be listed. Pages left out won't be displayed.

= Is it possible to display only the child-pages of a particular page? =
Yes. In order to achieve this, select the 'Include' option, select just the child-pages to be listed (leave out all other pages), enable the 'Show subpages' option and select 'Show all sub-pages'.

= How to customize the styling of items in the flexipages list? For example, how to indent the sub-pages? =

The flexipages widget inherits the styling of the sidebar elements as defined in the style.css of your theme. But you can customize the widget. The items in the flexipages list go within the class 'flexipages_widget'. So if you want to display the links in green color, try putting the code `.flexipages_widget a { color: #0f0; }` in the style.css of your theme. To indent the sub-pages, try `.flexipages_widget ul ul { margin-left:10px; }`.

= The widget treats a password protected page as any other page. Is there were a way to restrict the widget from showing password protected items until the password has been entered? =

The built-in WP function `get_pages()` treat password protected pages as any other page, and don't have an option to hide password protected pages until the password is entered. Flexi Pages Widget plugin depends on this function, and until the functions provide an option to hide password protected pages, we can't have it.

= The widget doesn't list private pages at all. Is there a way to show private pages when the admin is logged in? =

The built-in WP function `get_pages()` doesn't list private pages and doesn't have an option to show private pages. Flexi Pages Widget plugin depends on this functions, and until thes functions provide an option to show private pages when the admin is logged in, it's not possible for us to show private pages.

= Where do I ask a question about the plugin? =

Leave your questions, suggestions, bug reports, etc., as a comment at the [plugin page](http://srinig.com/wordpress-plugins/flexi-pages/ "Flexi Pages Widget") or through [contact form](http://srinig.com/contact/) at the author's website. Questions frequently asked will be incorporated into the FAQ section in future versions of the plugin.

== Localization ==

Versions 1.5.5 and above supports localization. The localization template file (flexipages.pot) can be found in the 'languages' folder of the plugin. The resulting PO and MO files should go in the 'flexi-pages-widget/languages/' directory, and should be named in the format `flexipages-xx_YY.po` and `flexipages-xx_YY.mo` files respectively. Where xx refers to the language code and YY to the locale. For example, the German translation files will have the name `flexipages-de_DE.po` and `flexipages-de_DE.mo`. This xx_YY should be the same as the value you define for WPLANG in wp-config.php.

An application like [poEdit](http://www.poedit.net/) can be used to translate the plugin, or just translate the strings in the flexipages.pot file and send it to the plugin author. All translations sent to the author will be bundled with the next version of the plugin.

==flexipages() template function==

Instead of using the widget, the function flexipages() can be called from anywhere in the template.

= Parameteres =

**sort_column** 

(string) Sorts the list of Pages in a number of different ways. The default setting is sort alphabetically by Page Order.

* 'post_title' - Sort Pages alphabetically (by title) - default
* 'menu_order' - Sort Pages by Page Order. N.B. Note the difference between Page Order and Page ID. The Page ID is a unique number assigned by WordPress to every post or page. The Page Order can be set by the user in the Write>Pages administrative panel.
* 'post_date' - Sort by creation time.
* 'post_modified' - Sort by time last modified.
* 'ID' - Sort by numeric Page ID.
* 'post_author' - Sort by the Page author's numeric ID.
* 'post_name' - Sort alphabetically by Post slug. 

**sort_order** 

(string) Change the sort order of the list of Pages (either ascending or descending). The default is ascending. Valid values:

* 'asc' - Sort from lowest to highest (Default).
* 'desc' - Sort from highest to lowest. 

**exclude** 

(string) Define a comma-separated list of Page IDs to be excluded from the list (example: 'exclude=3,7,31'). There is no default value. 

**include**

(string) Only include certain Pages in the list generated by get_pages. Like exclude, this parameter takes a comma-separated list of Page IDs. There is no default value. 

**child_of**

(integer) Displays the sub-pages of a single Page only; uses the ID for a Page as the value. Defaults to 0 (displays all Pages). Note that the child_of parameter will also fetch "grandchildren" of the given ID, not just direct descendants.

* 0 - default, no child_of restriction 

**parent** 
    
(integer) Displays those pages that have this ID as a parent. Defaults to -1 (displays all Pages regardless of parent). Note that this can be used to limit the 'depth' of the child_of parameter, so only one generation of descendants might be retrieved. You must use this in conjuction with the child_of parameter. Feed it the same ID.

* -1 - default, no parent restriction
* 0 - returns all top level pages 

**show_subpages**

* 0 - Do not show sub-pages. List only top level pages.
* 1 - Show sub-pages.
* 2 - Show only related sub-pages. A sub-page is listed only when the user visits the parent and sibling pages of the sub-page. Thus, this will display the top level pages, children and siblings of the current page, and siblings of the parent page.
* 3 - Show only strictly related sub-pages. Similar to '2' above except that siblings of parent page won't be displayed when on a sub-page.

**hierarchy**

(boolean) Display sub-Pages in an indented manner below their parent or list the Pages inline. The default is true (display sub-Pages indented below the parent list item). Valid values:

* 1 (true) - default
* 0 (false) 

**depth**

(integer) This parameter controls how many levels in the hierarchy of pages are to be included in the list generated by wp_list_pages. The default value is 0 (display all pages, including all sub-pages).

* 0 - Pages and sub-pages displayed in hierarchical (indented) form (Default).
* -1 - Pages and sub-pages displayed in flat (no indent) form.
* 1 - Show only top level Pages. Equivalent to 'show_subpages=0'.
* 2 - Value of 2 (or greater) specifies the depth (or level) to descend in displaying Pages. 

**dropdown**

(boolean) Whether to display the items in the widget as list or dropdown.

* 1 (True) - will display the items in dropdown format.
* 0 (False) - default - will display the items as list.

**echo**

(boolean) Toggles the display of the generated list of links or return the list as an HTML text string to be used in PHP. The default value is 1 (display the generated list items). Valid values:

* 1 (True) - default
* 0 (False) 

= Examples =

* `flexipages()` will display the list with default options.

* `flexipages('echo=0')` will *return* the list with default options for other parameters.

* `flexipages('echo=0&show_subpages=0')` will return only top level pages.

* `flexipages('sort_column=ID&exclude=2,10,14')` will display the list with items sorted in order of ID. The page IDs 2, 10 and 14 will be excluded.
