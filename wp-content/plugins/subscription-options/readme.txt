Adds subscription option icons for your RSS Feed; your FeedBurner Email Service; your Twitter Stream and your Facebook page. Totally user-defined.

== Description ==
The most common ways for people to subscribe to a blog and its content are through RSS, Email and Twitter. Facebook pages are increasing in usage too. This plugin places related subscription icons in a widget area and lets users enter their own feed or page URLs and select the colour of their icons. Its really simple but theres lots of power under the hood.

= Features: =
* Offers an attractive range of subscription options for your readers using familiar-looking icons.
* Intuitive interface for editing options, including your feed or page URLs, widget title and icon sizes.
* Independent handling across multiple widget instances, using WordPress 2.8's new widget_class coolness.
* NEW in Version 0.6 - the ability to select between 12 colours.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin by hitting that big red button to the right.
2. Extract the files and place the entire 'subscription-options' folder into your wp_content/plugins directory.
3. Go to your 'Installed Plugins' panel and activate 'Subscription Options'.
4. You are now ready to use the widget.

= Setup: =
* Go to your 'Appearance > Widgets' panel and select the widget area you wish for the plugin to appear in.
* Enter the following details:
1. Widget Title
2. RSS Feed URL & Colour ID
3. Email Service URL & Colour ID
4. Twitter Stream URL & Colour ID
5. Facebook Page URL & Colour ID
6. Size of Feed Icons

* Hit 'Save' then test the result. Change the icons' size and colour if necessary.
* Please note that you don't need to use all the icons - just don't enter a URL if you don't want an icon to show up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where do I put the widget? =
You can place the widget wherever you like as long as it is within a pre-defined widget area. I haven't worked out how to let people place the widget wherever they like. Let me know if you can help on my [contact page](http://digitalcortex.net/contact) though.

= Can I style the widget in my own way? =
Yes of course, it's WordPress! You can use your stylesheet.css to override your theme's default widget settings by using the following CSS classes:

* the RSS feed icon > img.rss_icon
* the email service icon > img.mail_icon
* the twitter icon > img.twitter_icon
* the facebook icon > img.facebook_icon

Please note that the icons' sizes will still need to be set from within the widget admin panel. CSS doesn't let you override that.
